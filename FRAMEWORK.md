# The TRACER Framework

TRACER is a acronym, a punny mnemonic harkening to phone call tracing or maybe a tracer bullet, I dunno. It sounds cool. The TRACER Framework is a 6 Pillar system for enabling, conducting, and utilizing network derived cyberthreat/cyberattack intelligence. The framework begins with the work that should be done (hopefully) before the cyber incident, provides guidance on detecting the incident before documenting and communicating during the _the incident_. Finally, the framework moves into mitigating the threat and refining processes and controls. You can read about it below, though as of uploading this to Github, I'm not ready to put all my writing out there.

## The Six Pillars

### TRUST: Network Appliance Integrity (Pre-Incident)
- Can you trust your Routers, Switches, Firewalls, Proxies, Load Balancers, IPS/IDS, NDRs have not been tampered with during an attack?
	- This is simple in practice but an administrative pain, and it's fundamental to the rest of the network forensics process. Harden your network appliances. If your switch logs can be tampered with by an attacker, they are worse than forensically useless: They have become part of the attack itself.
- Do you/your team have the competence to derive network forensic intelligence from network technologies?

### RECOGNIZE: Threat Identification (Incident Starts)
- Can you catch the threat? (Discover)
	- Do you have network-based threat detection systems in place. At minimum, Next-Gen Firewall, WAN Edge IDS, and an East-West NDR around business applications are required.
- Can you define the nature of the Threat's traffic so that it can be caught initially or in the future? (Signature/Fingerprinting/Etc)
	- Can you update these systems with the latest threat profile and create new profiles for emerging threats?

### ANALYZE: Threat Traffic Mapping (Active Threat Investigation)
- Can you then map the network traffic caused by the threat directly through C&C/recon/exploit/exfil and traversal, logically and chronologically?
- Leverage the Source->Destination Iterative Model
- This process may continue as additional intelligence is gathered and assessed well after the successful ENGAGE mitigation.

### COMMUNICATE: Threat Knowledge Collaboration and Documentation
- Can you work with other experts outside of your competence edge, silo, or separation of duties? Most attacks are not exclusively network attacks. The network forensics expert must be able to collaborate with other cybersecurity experts, systems teams, and sometimes legal and leadership.
- Can you document your findings?

### ENGAGE: Threat Response
- Can you articulate network controls to mitigate/thwart the active threat? This is why a network forensics expert must understand network and network service technologies from the endpoint NIC to the edge.
- Can you communicate your finding to influence Mitigation on non-network appliance/technology systems?

### REFINE: Threat Remediation and Services Restoration
- Can you communicate your findings to implement detective and preventative controls for a recurrent or like threat beyond the mitigating control employed at need? Refining should include the analysis of the whole attack and mitigating controls along the attack chain. Anyone can mitigate and attack by implementing a firewall ACL for the source, but defense in depth provides deeper protection for dynamic/polymorphic attacks.
- Can you validate the controls are effective?

## Framework Summary

**Trust → Recognize → Analyze → Communicate → Engage → Refine**

The TRACER Framework emphasizes the critical importance of network-based intelligence in cybersecurity incident response. By following these six pillars, security teams can systematically approach network forensics and threat analysis, ensuring that network evidence is properly collected, analyzed, and used to improve overall security posture.
