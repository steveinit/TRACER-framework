# TRACER PAL - Path Analysis Tool

**Version 0.2** - Interactive network forensics and path analysis for cybersecurity incident response.

> ðŸ“‹ **Important**: The TRACER network path analysis tool (TRACER PAL) is designed to empower security practitioners in the Analyze and Communicate pillars of the [TRACER Framework](FRAMEWORK.md) - a comprehensive methodology for network-based threat intelligence. Understanding the framework is essential for effective use of this tool. 

## Overview

TRACER PAL is a network path analysis tool designed for cybersecurity professionals conducting incident response and forensic investigations. It helps map/trace network traffic paths from source to destination (or offender to victim), documenting all network appliances and their configurations along the way. TRACER PAL should also be used alongside vulnerability assessments and offensive security operations to empower security practitioners with proactive intelligence.

**Key Features:**
- **Dual Interface**: Command-line tool and REST API
- **Flexible Storage**: Local JSON files or MongoDB Atlas cloud storage
- **Container Ready**: Docker deployment for production environments
- **Rich Documentation**: Detailed case analysis and reporting
- **Integration Friendly**: REST API for automation and SIEM integration

## Use Cases
- **Attack Surface Mapping/Tracing**: Document the exposed perimeters and endpoints from a network-centric perspective - This is your threat infiltration location - Allows security practitioners to refine perimeter and endpoint monitoring and controls.
- **Threat Traversal Mapping/Tracing**: Document network path traversed by the threat - This is your comprehensive blast radius: where the Threat went beyond the traditional "what they touched" - Allows security practitioners to take defense-in-depth approach to monitoring and controls.
- **Iterative Threat Emulation**: Think like a threat threat actor. Document attack paths as well as circumvention paths around controls and monitoring.
- **Control Implementation Assessment**: Validate controls perform as expected.

### Implementing Controls and Monitoring
The intelligence derived proactively and reactively from TRACER PAL informs the implementation and refinement of:
- Firewall Rules (Including Pass|Deny|[other] rules on Router|MultiLayer Switch|Proxy|Endpoint|Etc)
- IDS|IPS Monitoring and Response
- NDR Architecture, Monitoring, and Response

## Quick Start

### CLI Mode (Interactive Analysis)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/steveinit/TRACER-framework.git
cd TRACER-framework

# Run the interactive CLI
python3 tracer.py
```

### API Mode (Production/Integration)

```bash
# Setup virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure storage (optional)
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your MongoDB Atlas credentials if desired

# Start the API server
python api.py
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000` with interactive documentation at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

### Docker Deployment

```bash
# JSON storage (lightweight)
docker-compose -f docker-compose.json.yml up

# MongoDB Atlas (production)
docker-compose -f docker-compose.atlas.yml up

# Local MongoDB (development)
docker-compose up
```

## Example Analysis

Here's how TRACER documents a network path during incident investigation:

## Storage Options

TRACER automatically detects and configures storage based on your environment:

| Storage Type | Use Case | Setup |
|-------------|----------|-------|
| **JSON Files** | Development, small teams | No configuration needed |
| **MongoDB Atlas** | Production, team collaboration | Set `MONGODB_URL` environment variable |
| **Local MongoDB** | Development with cloud features | Use Docker Compose |

## REST API

The TRACER API provides programmatic access for automation and integration:

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/cases` | GET | List all cases |
| `/cases` | POST | Create new case |
| `/cases/{id}` | GET | Get case details |
| `/cases/{id}/elements` | POST | Add network element |
| `/cases/{id}/report` | GET | Generate analysis report |
